"""
You've encountered a situation where you want to easily be able to pull the
largest integer from a stack.
You already have a `Stack` class that you've implemented using a dynamic array.
Use this `Stack` class to implement a new class `MaxStack` with a method
`get_max()` that returns the largest element in the stack. `get_max()` should
not remove the item.
*Note: Your stacks will contain only integers. You should be able to get a
runtime of O(1) for push(), pop(), and get_max().*
